# Nvim-CoC configuration

Sometimes, the bloated neovim configuration causes problems. This is a minimal stable neovim configuration that uses [CoC](https://github.com/neoclide/coc.nvim), as a fallback editor.

Run using

```bash
NVIM_APPNAME=nvim-coc nvim

# or if you use the oh-my-zsh config, it's aliased as
vic
```
